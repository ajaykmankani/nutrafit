        <p><strong>OUR RETURN &amp; REFUND POLICY</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Can I return my order?</strong></p>
        <p>Yes, you can. We offer a 10-day return policy, no matter what your concern is. Maybe you didn&rsquo;t like the flavour of your product or maybe you simply changed your mind. Either way, we understand! If you&rsquo;re unhappy with your order, simply email us your order number within 10 days of receipt at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:<?= $email ?>"><?= $show_email ?></a>.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>What if I have ordered multiple items and only wish to return a few?</strong></p>
        <p>A return can be created for the individual items you wish to return. However, when returning any product, ensure that it contains all components and complimentary gifts that came along with it. All free gifts are included as a part of the item order and need to be returned with the originally delivered product. Note: you do not have to pay any shipping cost!</p>
        <p><strong>Will I be refunded for my returned order? How long does this take?</strong></p>
        <p>Yes, we refund all returned orders. We process your refund after your products are received and verified at our warehouse.</p>
        <p>For payments made through a credit or debit card, or via net banking, the refund will be processed to the same account from which the payment was made. For cash on delivery transactions, we will initiate a bank transfer of the refund amount against the billing details shared by you.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The refund always occurs within 7&ndash;14 business days of us receiving back the products. It may take 2&ndash;3 additional business days for the amount to reflect in your account.</p>
        <p>Additionally, we also provide the hassle-free option of a refund through <?= $brandname ?> coupons, which can be used during future purchases.</p>
        <p><strong>How will I be refunded for a cancelled&nbsp;order?&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>If you cancel your order before shipment, your refund is processed within 7&ndash;14 business days from us receiving the cancellation request. It may take 2&ndash;3 additional business days for the amount to reflect in your account.</p>
        <p>If you cancel after your shipment has been dispatched, your refund is processed only after your products have been received and verified at our warehouse.</p>
        <p>For payments made through a credit or debit card, or via net banking, the refund will be processed to the same account from which the payment was made. For cash on delivery transactions, we will initiate a bank transfer of the refund amount against the billing details shared by you.

        <p><strong>When can I replace a product?</strong></p>
        <p>We provide replacements when your order is damaged, defective, incomplete, or incorrect. All you have to do is email us at <?= $show_email ?> with your replacement request and order number!&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As soon as the complaint is validated by our Customer Service team, we will arrange for a pick-up of the existing order, and simultaneously prepare for the dispatch of the replacement product.</p>
        <p><strong>When can I cancel a product?</strong></p>
        <p>You can cancel your order anytime by emailing us at <?= $show_email ?> before the order is dispatched. Once dispatched, orders are not eligible for cancellation.</p>
